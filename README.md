# volume-controlling-gestures

Python application that allows you to control your computer's audio volume using hand gestures. Leveraging the power of Numpy, PyCaw, and Mediapipe, this project provides an intuitive and hands-free way to adjust your system's volume with simple hand movements.

Features:

Gesture Recognition: The core of this project relies on the robust gesture recognition capabilities of the Mediapipe library. The application can detect and interpret various hand gestures, making it easy to control volume levels.

Real-time Feedback: The application provides real-time visual feedback by overlaying hand landmarks on the screen, so you can see how your gestures are being detected and interpreted.

Smooth Volume Control: With the help of PyCaw, the application smoothly adjusts the system's audio volume based on the detected hand gestures. You can increase, decrease, or mute the volume with simple hand movements.

Configurability: The code is well-documented and easily customizable. You can tweak gesture recognition parameters and adjust volume control sensitivity to suit your preferences.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: This project is designed to work on various platforms, including Windows, Linux, and macOS, thanks to the cross-platform compatibility of Python.

Requirements: To run this application, you'll need Python, Numpy, PyCaw, and Mediapipe installed on your system. The repository provides clear installation instructions to help you get started.

Whether you want a fun project to experiment with computer vision and gesture recognition or you simply prefer a hands-free approach to controlling your audio, this Python Volume Control with Hand Gesture project is a fantastic addition to your toolkit.
